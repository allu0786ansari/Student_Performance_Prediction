# Student Performance Prediction
The Student Performance Prediction project aims to predict the academic performance of students based on various features such as study hours, attendance, parental education, and more. This predictive model helps in identifying students who may be at risk of underperforming, allowing educators to take early intervention measures.

The project uses machine learning techniques to analyze historical student data and generate predictions for future academic outcomes. By leveraging models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Linear Regression, this project aims to provide an accurate and reliable tool for forecasting student performance.

The objective is not only to predict scores but also to gain insights into the factors that most influence academic success, ultimately contributing to improving educational strategies and outcomes.
